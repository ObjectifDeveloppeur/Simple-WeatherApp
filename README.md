# Simple-WeatherApp

A weather application is a good project to practice code and architecture principles and techniques.

* The application is developed in Swift with [**SwiftUI**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/).

* The weather data is retrieved from the [**Apple WeatherKit Framework.**](https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/)

* As the latter does not provide the air quality index, we will retrieve the information from the [**Open Weather Map API**](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution).

* You will find in the code a **generic Networker** that you can use as you wish in your applications.

* To manage asynchronous tasks [**Swift Concurrency**](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html) is used.

* This project uses an **MVVM** architecture with **dependency injections**.
